# hybrix-jslib

This library can be used to connect software to leverage the
capabilities of the hybrix platform. It serves two purposes: first to
facilitate the logistics of interfacing with the hybrixd REST API,
secondly to handle all client-side operations securely and
privately. This ensures that keys required for transaction never leave
the users device and communication over an encrypted channel.
